## Recent Changes
* Added dark background/light background option.
  * Changed the background color to midnight blue for the dark background.
  * Changed all text and link colors to white for the dark background.
* Added the title attribute of 'Home' to the home page button (the button on the top left).
* Set the opacity to .5 for all links and buttons on hover.
* Added search field to the home page.
* Added pagination to the home and the tags pages with the current limit of 25 entries per page.
* Added a select field to the new entry and the edit entry pages which allows the user to select either hour(s) or minute(s) for the time spent.
* Changed the delete link in the detail page to a button with a confirmation box on click.
* Added delete all entries button to the home page with a confirmation box on click.
* Added two links on either side of the copyright in the footer which sends the user to the top of the page.

## Things to Improve
1. Allow the user to set the current limit of entries per page from the following choices: 10, 25, 50, 100, and all.
   * Works on the first page, but does not work on subsequent pages.
1. ~Allow the user to change the background from light to dark and vice versa.~
1. Prevent the Next Page button from showing on the last page if there are exactly 25 (or whatever limit the user has set if (1) has been implemented) entries on that page. No problems if there are less than 25 (or whatever limit the user has set if (1) has been implemented) entries on the page.
